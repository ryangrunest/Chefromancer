## Storyboard:

The evil Chefromancer has cast a spell on the guests of your dinner party. Bested only by the best dessert delicacies, you must beat him by making your tasty tiramisu. To create the tiramisu, you must traverse throughout the house collecting all the necessary ingredients found throughout the house, as well as a cake tin for baking the cake, and a cookbook to perfect the recipe. Be careful though, as the chefromancer uses his magical abilities to teleport throughout the house. If youâ€™re caught in the same room as him, he will knock you unconscious, steal all of the items in your inventory, and teleport you to a random location in the house.

When all of the ingredients and items have been collected, you must head to the kitchen to make the cake, and then go to the dining room to surprise the Chefromancer with your tasty tiramisu. If you create your cake without the correct ingredients, it uses all the ingredients. If you run out of available ingredients, you lose the game. After tasting your dessert delicacy his culinary ego will be destroyed, along with his powerful spell over your guests.
